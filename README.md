## Introduction

Early in 2020, the Ministry of Armed Forces of France announced their [call for new projects to fight against the pandemic](https://www.defense.gouv.fr/english/aid/appels-a-projets/appel-a-projets-lutte-covid-19) and were looking for new and innovative solutions to help civil servants, mostly in hospitals and similar sensitive places by using some recent technologies.

While the applications are currently officially closed, our university requested to their students to make and create their own solutions and submissions and contact the local authorities for the most interesting, serious and innovating projects selected by our school.

## Description

Soon.
