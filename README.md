## Introduction

Early in 2020, the Ministry of Armed Forces of France announced their [call for new projects to fight against the pandemic](https://www.defense.gouv.fr/english/aid/appels-a-projets/appel-a-projets-lutte-covid-19) and were looking for new and innovative solutions to help civil servants, mostly in hospitals and similar sensitive places by using some recent technologies.

While the applications are currently officially closed, our university requested to their students to make and create their own solutions and submissions. Local authorities will be contacted for the most interesting, serious and innovating projects selected by our university.

## Short description

To respond to this call, us, a group of 4 students decided to create a small service (likely a prototype) which will be easily manageable and deployable (with Docker) to quickly deploy an infrastructure (server) for health/medical services with an intranet (website), database and API, without any.

### Key features

* **Ready-to-go.** Using Docker to deploy and configure all dependencies automatically
* **Real time stats.**  Select and display important/key values to be live-fetched with an API
* **Patients management.** Add, create/edit/delete patients information with multiple privacy/permissions checks
* **Organization.** Permissions presets, configurable permissions, manage multiple departments with an administration panel
* **Work routine tool.** See and manage your recent activities, personal notes and daily/weekly/monthly planning
* **Real-time messaging.** Messaging between workers and other health departments, to stay connected without using third party platforms
